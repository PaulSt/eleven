With Ruby installed one can run the following to install bundler and jekyll
```bash
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

Create a Gemfile (called Gemfile) with the contents
```
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "eleven-theme"
gem "webrick"
```
and a config called _config.yml with the contents
```
remote_theme: PaulSt/eleven
theme: eleven
```

And optionally we can already put a landing page inside, written in markdown, called index.md
```text
---
layout: home
---
Hello World!
```

Once those are safely tucked into a folder we are ready to call
```bash
$ bundle install
```
to install whatever our gemfile says.
Then all that is left to do to view the site locally is to call
```bash
$ jekyll s 
```
In case this complains about the versions installed on your system try with 
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll s --trace
```
